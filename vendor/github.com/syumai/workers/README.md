* `workers` is a package to run an HTTP server written in Go on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
* This package can easily serve *http.Handler* on Cloudflare Workers.
* Caution: This is an experimental project.

* [x] Cron Triggers
* [x] TCP Sockets

## Installation

```
go get github.com/syumai/workers
```

## Usage

implement your http.Handler and give it to `workers.Serve()`.

```go
func main() {
	var handler http.HandlerFunc = func (w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { ... }
	workers.Serve(handler)
}
```

or just call `http.Handle` and `http.HandleFunc`, then invoke `workers.Serve()` with nil.

```go
func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", func (w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { ... })
	workers.Serve(nil) // if nil is given, http.DefaultServeMux is used.
}
```

For concrete examples, see `_examples` directory.
Currently, all examples use tinygo instead of Go due to binary size issues.

## Quick Start

First, please install the following tools:

* Node.js (and npm)
* [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)
  - You can install it by running `npm install -g wrangler`.
* tinygo 0.29.0 or later
* [gonew](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gonew)
  - You can install it by running `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gonew@latest`

After installation, please run the following commands.

```console
gonew github.com/syumai/workers/_templates/cloudflare/worker-tinygo your.module/my-app # e.g. github.com/syumai/my-app
cd my-app
go mod tidy
make dev # start running dev server
curl http://localhost:8787/hello # outputs "Hello!"
```

If you want a more detailed description, please refer to the README.md file in the generated directory.

## FAQ

### How do I deploy a worker implemented in this package?

To deploy a Worker, the following steps are required.

* Create a worker project using [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).
* Build a Wasm binary.
* Upload a Wasm binary with a JavaScript code to load and instantiate Wasm (for entry point).

The [worker-tinygo template](https://github.com/syumai/workers/tree/main/_templates/cloudflare/worker-tinygo) contains all the required files, so I recommend using this template.

The [worker-go template](https://github.com/syumai/workers/tree/main/_templates/cloudflare/worker-go) (using regular Go, not tinygo) is also available, but it requires a paid plan of Cloudflare Workers (due to the large binary size).

### Where can I have discussions about contributions, or ask questions about how to use the library?

You can do both through GitHub Issues. If you want to have a more casual conversation, please use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tYhtatRqGs).
